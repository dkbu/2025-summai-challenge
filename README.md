# BPMN Real-Time Collaboration Challenge

Welcome to the SUMM AI take-home assignment.

Your task: build a **minimal, real-time collaborative BPMN diagram editor**.

---

## 🧩 Core Features

- Render BPMN diagrams in the browser using **bpmn.io** (`bpmn-js`).
- Edit the diagram - changes should appear live for all connected users.
- Show a simple “online users” indicator.
- Store the current BPMN diagram in memory (no need for a DB).

**Bonus:** show a lock/marker when another user is editing a BPMN element.

---

## 🛠️ Notes

- Use any frontend framework (React, Vue, etc.).
- Backend would be preferrably in FastAPI (Python) but you can use any other backend framework you're comfortable with.
- No authentication is required.
- Keep it simple.
